# Cybersecurity Portfolio

## Introduction
This repository contains my practical exercises, labs, and projects completed as part of my cybersecurity learning journey. 
It demonstrates my skills in areas such as network security, digital forensics, incident response, and penetration testing.

## Structure
The portfolio is organized by modules and labs:

- `module1-basics/` → Fundamentals of cybersecurity, threats, vulnerabilities, and best practices.

- `...` → Future modules and projects will be added here.

Each module contains:
- `README.md` → Overview of the module
- Lab files (`*.md`) → Step-by-step documentation of exercises
